We do not remember days, we remember moments.
Everyone has one's own path.
If you wish to be loved, love!
Never say never.
World belongs to the patient...
Everyone sees the world in one's own way.
You and I - belong.
Everyone is the creator of one's own fate.
Nobody's perfect, but me.
Never look back.
Every solution breeds new problems.
A day without laughter is a day wasted.
I can resist anything except temptation.
While I'm breathing - I love and believe.
Everyone is the creator of one's own fate.
